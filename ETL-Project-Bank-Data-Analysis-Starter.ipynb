        "In this case study, you will be working on Banking Data Analysis using Apache Spark, a powerful distributed computing framework designed for big data processing. This assignment aims to give you hands-on experience in analyzing large-scale banking datasets using PySpark and AWS services. You will apply techniques learned in data analytics to clean, transform, and explore banking data, drawing meaningful insights to support financial decision-making. Apart from understanding how big data tools can optimize performance on a single machine and across clusters, you will develop a structured approach to analyzing market capitalization trends, currency conversions, and global banking performance. Additionally, you will use AWS S3 to store the processed data once the ETL pipeline is complete, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.\n"

To stay competitive, banks must leverage data-driven insights to optimize their financial strategies, assess market trends, and make informed decisions. In this assignment, you will analyze banking data to uncover patterns in market capitalization, currency conversions, and global rankings. With Apache Spark's ability to handle large datasets efficiently, financial institutions can process vast amounts of data in real-time, helping them make faster and more informed decisions.\n",

Your analysis will help identify the top 10 largest banks by market capitalization, convert market cap values into multiple currencies (USD, GBP, EUR, INR), and store the processed data for easy retrieval. To enhance scalability and accessibility, you will utilize AWS S3 for data storage, ensuring seamless integration with cloud-based analytics tools. By leveraging big data analytics and cloud services, financial institutions can streamline operations, enhance decision-making, and maximize revenue opportunities.\n"
